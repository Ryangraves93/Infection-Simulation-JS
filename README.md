# Infection-Simulation-JS

A project for college to replicate a viral infection spread through p5.js. It uses spatial partitioning for collision checks. When a "health" entitiy
gets infected, it will lerp it's color value for 3 seconds and then creates a square, using a new collision system untill the entitiy is recovered and 
returns to a normal state.
